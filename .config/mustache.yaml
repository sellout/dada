    Recursion schemes allow you to separate recursion from your business logic â€“
    making your own operations simpler, more modular, and less error-prone. This
    library also provides tools for combining your operations in ways that
    reduce the number of passes over your data and is designed to encourage
    total (that is, successfully terminating) functions.
